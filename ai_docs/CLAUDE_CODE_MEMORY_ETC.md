# Manage Claude's memory

> Learn how to manage Claude Code's memory across sessions with different memory locations and best practices.

Claude Code can remember your preferences across sessions, like style guidelines and common commands in your workflow.

## Determine memory type

Claude Code offers three memory locations, each serving a different purpose:

| Memory Type                | Location              | Purpose                                  | Use Case Examples                                                |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Project memory**         | `./CLAUDE.md`         | Team-shared instructions for the project | Project architecture, coding standards, common workflows         |
| **User memory**            | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | Personal preferences for all projects    | Code styling preferences, personal tooling shortcuts             |
| **Project memory (local)** | `./CLAUDE.local.md`   | Personal project-specific preferences    | *(Deprecated, see below)* Your sandbox URLs, preferred test data |

All memory files are automatically loaded into Claude Code's context when launched.

## CLAUDE.md imports

CLAUDE.md files can import additional files using `@path/to/import` syntax. The following example imports 3 files:

```
See @README for project overview and @package.json for available npm commands for this project.

# Additional Instructions
- git workflow @docs/git-instructions.md
```

Both relative and absolute paths are allowed. In particular, importing files in user's home dir is a convenient way for your team members to provide individual instructions that are not checked into the repository. Previously CLAUDE.local.md served a similar purpose, but is now deprecated in favor of imports since they work better across multiple git worktrees.

```
# Individual Preferences
- @~/.claude/my-project-instructions.md
```

To avoid potential collisions, imports are not evaluated inside markdown code spans and code blocks.

```
This code span will not be treated as an import: `@anthropic-ai/claude-code`
```

Imported files can recursively import additional files, with a max-depth of 5 hops. You can see what memory files are loaded by running `/memory` command.

## How Claude looks up memories

Claude Code reads memories recursively: starting in the cwd, Claude Code recurses up to */* and reads any CLAUDE.md or CLAUDE.local.md files it finds. This is especially convenient when working in large repositories where you run Claude Code in *foo/bar/*, and have memories in both *foo/CLAUDE.md* and *foo/bar/CLAUDE.md*.

Claude will also discover CLAUDE.md nested in subtrees under your current working directory. Instead of loading them at launch, they are only included when Claude reads files in those subtrees.

## Quickly add memories with the `#` shortcut

The fastest way to add a memory is to start your input with the `#` character:

```
# Always use descriptive variable names
```

You'll be prompted to select which memory file to store this in.

## Directly edit memories with `/memory`

Use the `/memory` slash command during a session to open any memory file in your system editor for more extensive additions or organization.

## Memory best practices

* **Be specific**: "Use 2-space indentation" is better than "Format code properly".
* **Use structure to organize**: Format each individual memory as a bullet point and group related memories under descriptive markdown headings.
* **Review periodically**: Update memories as your project evolves to ensure Claude is always using the most up to date information and context.

# Claude Code settings

> Learn how to configure Claude Code with global and project-level settings, themes, and environment variables.

Claude Code offers a variety of settings to configure its behavior to meet your
needs. You can configure Claude Code by running the `/config` command when using
the interactive REPL.

## Settings files

The new `settings.json` file format is our official mechanism for configuring Claude
Code through hierarchical settings:

* **User settings** are defined in `~/.claude/settings.json` and apply to all
  projects.
* **Project settings** are saved in your project directory under
  `.claude/settings.json` for shared settings, and `.claude/settings.local.json`
  for local project settings. Claude Code will configure git to ignore
  `.claude/settings.local.json` when it is created.
* For enterprise deployments of Claude Code, we also support **enterprise
  managed policy settings**. These take precedence over user and project
  settings. System administrators can deploy policies to
  `/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCode/policies.json` on macOS and
  `/etc/claude-code/policies.json` on Linux and Windows via WSL.

```JSON Example settings.json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "Bash(npm run lint)",
      "Bash(npm run test:*)",
      "Read(~/.zshrc)"
    ],
    "deny": [
      "Bash(curl:*)"
    ]
  },
  "env": {
    "CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY": "1",
    "OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER": "otlp"
  }
}
```

### Available settings

`settings.json` supports a number of options:

| Key                   | Description                                                                              | Example                               |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| `apiKeyHelper`        | `/bin/sh` execution, `X-Api-Key`, `Authorization: Bearer`, `Proxy-Authorization: Bearer` | `/bin/generate_temp_api_key.sh`       |
| `cleanupPeriodDays`   | How long to locally retain chat transcripts (default: 30 days)                           | `20`                                  |
| `env`                 | Environment variables that will be applied to every session                              | `{"FOO": "bar"}`                      |
| `includeCoAuthoredBy` | Include `co-authored-by Claude` git byline (default: `true`)                             | `false`                               |
| `permissions`         | `allow` and `deny` keys are a list of permission rules                                   | `{"allow": [ "Bash(npm run lint)" ]}` |

### Settings precedence

Settings are applied in order of precedence:

1. Enterprise policies
2. Command line arguments
3. Local project settings
4. Shared project settings
5. User settings

## Permissions

You can view & manage Claude Code's tool permissions with `/permissions`. This UI
lists all permission rules and the settings.json file they are sourced from.

* **Allow** rules will allow Claude Code to use the specified tool without
  further manual approval.
* **Deny** rules will prevent Claude Code from using the specified tool. Deny
  rules take precedence over allow rules.

Permission rules use the format: `Tool(optional-specifier)`

A rule that is just the tool name matched any use of that tool.
For example, adding `Bash` to the list of allow rules would allow Claude Code to use
the Bash tool without requiring user approval. See the list of
[tools available to Claude](security#tools-available-to-claude).

### Tool-specific permission rules

Some tools use the optional specifier for more fine-grained permission controls.
For example, an allow rule with `Bash(git diff:*)` would allow Bash commands
that start with `git diff`. The following tools support permission rules with specifiers:

#### Bash

* `Bash(npm run build)` Matches the exact Bash command `npm run build`
* `Bash(npm run test:*)` Matches Bash commands starting with `npm run test`.

<Tip>
  Claude Code is aware of shell operators (like `&&`) so a prefix match rule
  like `Bash(safe-cmd:*)` won't give it permission to run the command `safe-cmd
  && other-cmd`
</Tip>

#### Read & Edit

`Edit` rules apply to all built-in tools that edit files.
Claude will make a best-effort attempt to apply `Read` rules to
all built-in tools that read files like Grep, Glob, and LS.

Read & Edit rules both follow the
[gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) specification. Patterns are
resolved relative to the directory containing `.claude/settings.json`. To
reference an absolute path, use `//`. For a path relative to your home
directory, use `~/`.

* `Edit(docs/**)` Matches edits to files in the `docs` directory of your project
* `Read(~/.zshrc)` Matches reads to your `~/.zshrc` file
* `Edit(//tmp/scratch.txt)` Matches edits to `/tmp/scratch.txt`

#### WebFetch

* `WebFetch(domain:example.com)` Matches fetch requests to example.com

#### MCP

* `mcp__puppeteer` Matches any tool provided by the `puppeteer` server (name configured in Claude Code)
* `mcp__puppeteer__puppeteer_navigate` Matches the `puppeteer_navigate` tool provided by the `puppeteer` server

## Auto-updater permission options

When Claude Code detects that it doesn't have sufficient permissions to write to
your global npm prefix directory (required for automatic updates), you'll see a
warning that points to this documentation page. For detailed solutions to
auto-updater issues, see the
[troubleshooting guide](/en/docs/claude-code/troubleshooting#auto-updater-issues).

### Recommended: Create a new user-writable npm prefix

```bash
# First, save a list of your existing global packages for later migration
npm list -g --depth=0 > ~/npm-global-packages.txt

# Create a directory for your global packages
mkdir -p ~/.npm-global

# Configure npm to use the new directory path
npm config set prefix ~/.npm-global

# Note: Replace ~/.bashrc with ~/.zshrc, ~/.profile, or other appropriate file for your shell
echo 'export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc

# Apply the new PATH setting
source ~/.bashrc

# Now reinstall Claude Code in the new location
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Optional: Reinstall your previous global packages in the new location
# Look at ~/npm-global-packages.txt and install packages you want to keep
# npm install -g package1 package2 package3...
```

**Why we recommend this option:**

* Avoids modifying system directory permissions
* Creates a clean, dedicated location for your global npm packages
* Follows security best practices

Since Claude Code is actively developing, we recommend setting up auto-updates
using the recommended option above.

### Disabling the auto-updater

If you prefer to disable the auto-updater instead of fixing permissions, you can
set the `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER` [environment variable](#environment-variables) to `1`

## Optimize your terminal setup

Claude Code works best when your terminal is properly configured. Follow these
guidelines to optimize your experience.

**Supported shells**:

* Bash
* Zsh
* Fish

### Themes and appearance

Claude cannot control the theme of your terminal. That's handled by your
terminal application. You can match Claude Code's theme to your terminal during
onboarding or any time via the `/config` command

### Line breaks

You have several options for entering linebreaks into Claude Code:

* **Quick escape**: Type `\` followed by Enter to create a newline
* **Keyboard shortcut**: Press Option+Enter (Meta+Enter) with proper
  configuration

To set up Option+Enter in your terminal:

**For Mac Terminal.app:**

1. Open Settings → Profiles → Keyboard
2. Check "Use Option as Meta Key"

**For iTerm2 and VSCode terminal:**

1. Open Settings → Profiles → Keys
2. Under General, set Left/Right Option key to "Esc+"

**Tip for iTerm2 and VSCode users**: Run `/terminal-setup` within Claude Code to
automatically configure Shift+Enter as a more intuitive alternative.

### Notification setup

Never miss when Claude completes a task with proper notification configuration:

#### Terminal bell notifications

Enable sound alerts when tasks complete:

```sh
claude config set --global preferredNotifChannel terminal_bell
```

**For macOS users**: Don't forget to enable notification permissions in System
Settings → Notifications → \[Your Terminal App].

#### iTerm 2 system notifications

For iTerm 2 alerts when tasks complete:

1. Open iTerm 2 Preferences
2. Navigate to Profiles → Terminal
3. Enable "Silence bell" and Filter Alerts → "Send escape sequence-generated
   alerts"
4. Set your preferred notification delay

Note that these notifications are specific to iTerm 2 and not available in the
default macOS Terminal.

### Handling large inputs

When working with extensive code or long instructions:

* **Avoid direct pasting**: Claude Code may struggle with very long pasted
  content
* **Use file-based workflows**: Write content to a file and ask Claude to read
  it
* **Be aware of VS Code limitations**: The VS Code terminal is particularly
  prone to truncating long pastes

### Vim Mode

Claude Code supports a subset of Vim keybindings that can be enabled with `/vim`
or configured via `/config`.

The supported subset includes:

* Mode switching: `Esc` (to NORMAL), `i`/`I`, `a`/`A`, `o`/`O` (to INSERT)
* Navigation: `h`/`j`/`k`/`l`, `w`/`e`/`b`, `0`/`$`/`^`, `gg`/`G`
* Editing: `x`, `dw`/`de`/`db`/`dd`/`D`, `cw`/`ce`/`cb`/`cc`/`C`, `.` (repeat)

## Environment variables

Claude Code supports the following environment variables to control its
behavior:

<Note>
  All environment variables can also be configured in
  [`settings.json`](#available-settings). This is
  useful as a way to automatically set environment variables for each session,
  or to roll out a set of environment variables for your whole team or
  organization.

## Configuration options

We are in the process of migration global configuration to `settings.json`.

`claude config` will be deprecated in place of [settings.json](#settings-files)

To manage your configurations, use the following commands:

* List settings: `claude config list`
* See a setting: `claude config get <key>`
* Change a setting: `claude config set <key> <value>`
* Push to a setting (for lists): `claude config add <key> <value>`
* Remove from a setting (for lists): `claude config remove <key> <value>`

By default `config` changes your project configuration. To manage your global
configuration, use the `--global` (or `-g`) flag.

### Global configuration

To set a global configuration, use `claude config set -g <key> <value>`:

| Key                     | Description                                                      | Example                                                                    |
| :---------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `autoUpdaterStatus`     | Enable or disable the auto-updater (default: `enabled`)          | `disabled`                                                                 |
| `preferredNotifChannel` | Where you want to receive notifications (default: `iterm2`)      | `iterm2`, `iterm2_with_bell`, `terminal_bell`, or `notifications_disabled` |
| `theme`                 | Color theme                                                      | `dark`, `light`, `light-daltonized`, or `dark-daltonized`                  |
| `verbose`               | Whether to show full bash and command outputs (default: `false`) | `true`                                                                     |

# Manage permissions and security

> Learn about Claude Code's permission system, tools access, and security safeguards.

Claude Code uses a tiered permission system to balance power and safety:

| Tool Type         | Example              | Approval Required | "Yes, don't ask again" Behavior               |
| :---------------- | :------------------- | :---------------- | :-------------------------------------------- |
| Read-only         | File reads, LS, Grep | No                | N/A                                           |
| Bash Commands     | Shell execution      | Yes               | Permanently per project directory and command |
| File Modification | Edit/write files     | Yes               | Until session end                             |

Permission rules can be configured using `/allowed-tools` or in [permission settings](/en/docs/claude-code/settings#permissions).

## Protect against prompt injection

Prompt injection is a technique where an attacker attempts to override or manipulate an AI assistant's instructions by inserting malicious text. Claude Code includes several safeguards against these attacks:

* **Permission system**: Sensitive operations require explicit approval
* **Context-aware analysis**: Detects potentially harmful instructions by analyzing the full request
* **Input sanitization**: Prevents command injection by processing user inputs
* **Command blocklist**: Blocks risky commands that fetch arbitrary content from the web like `curl` and `wget`

**Best practices for working with untrusted content**:

1. Review suggested commands before approval
2. Avoid piping untrusted content directly to Claude
3. Verify proposed changes to critical files
4. Report suspicious behavior with `/bug`

<Warning>
  While these protections significantly reduce risk, no system is completely
  immune to all attacks. Always maintain good security practices when working
  with any AI tool.
</Warning>

## Configure network access

Claude Code requires access to:

* api.anthropic.com
* statsig.anthropic.com
* sentry.io

Allowlist these URLs when using Claude Code in containerized environments.

## Development container reference implementation

Claude Code provides a development container configuration for teams that need consistent, secure environments. This preconfigured [devcontainer setup](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) works seamlessly with VS Code's Remote - Containers extension and similar tools.

The container's enhanced security measures (isolation and firewall rules) allow you to run `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` to bypass permission prompts for unattended operation. We've included a [reference implementation](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/.devcontainer) that you can customize for your needs.

<Warning>
  While the devcontainer provides substantial protections, no system is
  completely immune to all attacks. Always maintain good security practices and
  monitor Claude's activities.
</Warning>

### Key features

* **Production-ready Node.js**: Built on Node.js 20 with essential development dependencies
* **Security by design**: Custom firewall restricting network access to only necessary services
* **Developer-friendly tools**: Includes git, ZSH with productivity enhancements, fzf, and more
* **Seamless VS Code integration**: Pre-configured extensions and optimized settings
* **Session persistence**: Preserves command history and configurations between container restarts
* **Works everywhere**: Compatible with macOS, Windows, and Linux development environments

### Getting started in 4 steps

1. Install VS Code and the Remote - Containers extension
2. Clone the [Claude Code reference implementation](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/tree/main/.devcontainer) repository
3. Open the repository in VS Code
4. When prompted, click "Reopen in Container" (or use Command Palette: Cmd+Shift+P → "Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container")

### Configuration breakdown

The devcontainer setup consists of three primary components:

* [**devcontainer.json**](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json): Controls container settings, extensions, and volume mounts
* [**Dockerfile**](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/.devcontainer/Dockerfile): Defines the container image and installed tools
* [**init-firewall.sh**](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/blob/main/.devcontainer/init-firewall.sh): Establishes network security rules

### Security features

The container implements a multi-layered security approach with its firewall configuration:

* **Precise access control**: Restricts outbound connections to whitelisted domains only (npm registry, GitHub, Anthropic API, etc.)
* **Default-deny policy**: Blocks all other external network access
* **Startup verification**: Validates firewall rules when the container initializes
* **Isolation**: Creates a secure development environment separated from your main system

### Customization options

The devcontainer configuration is designed to be adaptable to your needs:

* Add or remove VS Code extensions based on your workflow
* Modify resource allocations for different hardware environments
* Adjust network access permissions
* Customize shell configurations and developer tooling
