## Overview

This project uses a custom Claude Code slash command (`/project:infinite`) to orchestrate multiple AI agents in parallel, generating evolving iterations of content based on specifications.

## Usage

Read `.claude/settings.json` to see the permissions and commands allowed.

Start Claude Code: `claude`

Type slash command `/project:infinite` to start the infinite agentic loop.

The infinite command takes three arguments:
```
/project:infinite <spec_file> <output_dir> <count>
```

### 4 Command Variants

#### 1. Single Generation
```bash
/project:infinite specs/invent_new_ui_v3.md src 1
```
Generate one new iteration using the UI specification.

#### 2. Small Batch (5 iterations)
```bash
/project:infinite specs/invent_new_ui_v3.md src_new 5
```
Deploy 5 parallel agents to generate 5 unique iterations simultaneously.

#### 3. Large Batch (20 iterations)  
```bash
/project:infinite specs/invent_new_ui_v3.md src_new 20
```
Generate 20 iterations in coordinated batches of 5 agents for optimal resource management.

#### 4. Infinite Mode
```bash
/project:infinite specs/invent_new_ui_v3.md infinite_src_new/ infinite
```
Continuous generation in waves until context limits are reached, with progressive sophistication.

## How It Works

1. **Specification Analysis**: Reads and understands the spec file requirements
2. **Directory Reconnaissance**: Analyzes existing iterations to determine starting point
3. **Parallel Coordination**: Deploys Sub Agents with unique creative directions
4. **Quality Assurance**: Ensures each iteration is unique and spec-compliant
5. **Wave Management**: For infinite mode, manages successive waves of agents

## Directions you can take to enhance this pattern

- Apply this to a use case of your choice.
- Build an MCP Server that enables reuse of the infinite agentic loop.
- Get the `.claude/commands/infinite.md` into your `~/.claude/commands/` directory for global use.
- Update `.claude/commands/infinite.md` to generate sets of files instead of a single file.
